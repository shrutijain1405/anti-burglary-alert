# anti-burglary-alert
This system is to safeguard your home from unwarranted thefts and intrusions in the night. The idea is to use the ultrasonic sensor to check the proximity of the intruder when the all the lights of the house are switched off (ie, when the owner is sleeping or absent) and buzz the alarm if the intruder happens to come too close, as well send an alert to the owner of the house, warning them about the intruder. The alarm keeps on going, till a pin, which is exclusively known to the owner, is entered, disarming the entire security system . The system can be rearmed upon will by the owner by a separate exclusive pin. If the owner happens to expect guests during the night, the system can be disarmed beforehand.

# The system uses :
- Ultrasonic sensor
- RGB led
- Arduino Uno
- Buzzer
- LDR
